\chapter{Defining Small Categories}\label{chap:DefSmallCats}

\begin{Example}\label{ex:Mat}
The category $\cat{Mat}_{R}$ has the set of natural numbers $\mathbb N$ as its set of objects and the set of all matrices with entries from the ring $R$ as its set of arrows. For $m, n \in \mathbb N$, the arrows from $n$ to $m$ are all the $m \times n$ $R$-matrices, and composition of arrows is matrix multiplication. Given $A \colon n \to m$ and $B \colon m \to p$, the product $BA$ is defined and is a $p \times n$ matrix --- i.e., $BA$ is an arrow from $n$ to $p$. The identity arrow of $n$ is the identity matrix $I_n$ of order $n$.
